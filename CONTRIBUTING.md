- To contribute to this project we would recommend fork this and find a friend to pair. 
- After you finish working on your fork, make a Pull Request and find two reviewers so we could make this collaborative.
- Unit tests are mandatory to new features, but you dont need to test any plugin specific functionality 
- If you plan to make any refactory, discuss with old contributors at https://t.me/joinchat/AfhaV0XSlMQFRcYnMddG8w
- Create an issue with Tech Debts for your story if you can identify any. 
- We don't demand to you paying all the tech debts you create during the development of new features, but we would encourage creating a second pull request paying the tech debts before submiting new features
- After your first feature pull request approval you could be invited to be a reviewer as well so you could help new contributors
