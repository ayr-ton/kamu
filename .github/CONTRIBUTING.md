3. Unit tests are mandatory to new features, but you dont need to test any plugin specific functionality 
4. If you plan to make any refactory, discuss with old contributors at https://t.me/joinchat/AfhaV0XSlMQFRcYnMddG8w
5. Create an issue with Tech Debts for your story if you can identify any. 
6. We don't demand to you paying all the tech debts you create during the development of new features, but we would encourage creating a second pull request paying the tech debts before submiting new features
7. After your first feature pull request approval you could be invited to be a reviewer as well so you could help new contributors
